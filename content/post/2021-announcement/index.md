It's been a while since I started this website. I feel that some blogs are good in English but hard to translate or pass the feelings in Chinese, and some are in the opposite way. So I decide to stop writing every blog in both languages, unless I feel it is worthy to do that such as blogs about daily life or cultures, which I want to share to everyone. Well, I will make the English version as the primary one since I'm working with English now. So you will see most of my blogs in the English website.

Thanks for your time reading my blogs and feel free to chat with me using the disqus in each post or the contact at the end of the website!
