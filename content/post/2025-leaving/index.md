I started my postdoc at Yale in November 2024, and I was very nervous but also excited to have my first job ever. Over this year, I have met many new friends and learned many new things. I have not only gained a lot of new research and collaboration experience, but I have also practiced my organizing skills through BDSY. It has been a tough but very fruitful year.

I have made the tough decision to leave Yale. I want to thank everyone in DSDE and at Yale Biostatistics. I will carry our happy moments and memories with me into the next stages of my life and career, and I wish you all the very best in yours. Hope to see you again in the future!
