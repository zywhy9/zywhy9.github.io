Since the pandemic began, I have stayed in Canada and seen my friends back to China. At first, I was okay with it since staying at home is not a big problem for me. That's basically what I do for my free time. However, with the stay-at-home order, we cannot go to restaurants or even my office, which is reasonable but make me down. As a result, I decided to buy a flight ticket in March. Though it's a little late since I need to come back in Fall for the proposal, I still want to have a trip to somewhere.

My flight is on June 13th and I need to be quarantined for 28 days (21 days in hotel and 7 days in home). Not like the quarantine in Canada, in China it's more like a house confinement. Even at home, there cannot be anyone else or you need to stay in the hotel. And the door of your home will be sealed to make sure you won't come out. Well, though it's strict, it's effective. Now you can travel around China, and no need to worry about the virus. I think this is a good example about the culture gap. Chinese always thinks about the whole society, while western culture focuses more on the personal benefits.

I will be back on September 13th. If the situation is better at that time, feel free to call me for a party! I hope to meet you guys in the new academic year!
