The new year is coming. We suffered a lot in this old year. At the same time, we got used to a lot of things. We got used to stay at home. We got uesd to wear a mask. We got used to have a course online. What a year! Thanks to my girlfriend moving to my house, I could spend this hard time with her.

## Gifts & Toys

At least, I got the time to learn how to play my guitar, which is my last year's birthday gift from my girlfriend. I also enjoy my first Lego, which is my birthday gift from one of my best friends since childhood. And I feel I've fallen into this Lego trap since I just bought two more Legos... For this toy in the picture, I saw a little girl playing with it on the ION last year, and I'm so curious about it since I found it may be related to fractal geometry. However, I didn't find it in any toy shops or supermarkets. Few days ago, I found it on Amazon and my girlfriend bought it for me as a new year gift. I think it's partially because that she loves my gift, a Yamaha digital piano~

## Academic

Well, I finally finished all my coursework as a student. Though there is still a long way to go in the school, it feels a new stage has come. I indeed feel the pressure when I heard some of my friends have published a paper or saw my friend's name on arXiv. But I have felt hopelessness and despair when comparing with my classmates during my masters. Having passed that period, I konw how impartant a good mood is for a graduate student. Hope I can have some achievement this year and pass the proposal successfully.

## Other

For now, I really want to fly back to China and stay with my family. However, I still need to finish my paper for EURING and prepare for my proposal after that. And I'm not sure if I can come back smoothly few months later. Anyway, at least my girlfriend will be here until April, so I'll consider the flight at that time maybe. Just watching my friends eating delicious food in China makes me really envy~ 

After 3 hours, the new year is coming. Happy new year to everyone and hope you have a wonderful new year!
