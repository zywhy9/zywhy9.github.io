After searching and trying for 3 days, I finally learned how to use Hugo and this Academic theme to build a personal website. So this website is for both academic writing and personal blogs. New year is coming and I will give you some fun facts about me as a new year present.

* I was born in [Dalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian), Liaoning, China.  When I was celebrating my five-year-old birthday, we were also celebrating the return of Macao (you know my birthday now). My parents are both working in a university and they influence me a lot.

* My motto for studying is: **Curiosity is the best teacher**. I'm always trying to be a kid, so that I can be curious about everything and be creative for any question.

* I like traveling. I started traveling with my parents when I was one-and-a-half-year-old to my father's hometown. From then, I travelled with my parents every year. Until now, I have been to:

   China (provinces): Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,  Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Neimenggu/Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang (23/34 Provinces)

   Japan (prefectures with cities): Tokyo (Tokyo), Kyoto (Kyoto), Osaka (Osaka), Nara (Nara), Aichi (Nagoya), Hyogo (Kobe), Chiba (Disneyland), Yamanashi (Mt. Fuji)

   U.S. (states): California, Illinois,  Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Wisconsin, District of Columbia

   Canada (provinces): Ontario (Toronto, Waterloo, Niagara Falls), Québec (Montréal)

* I like music. I can play [Erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu). I'm trying to learn some guitar. My favorite band is [Sodagreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodagreen).
